## About Me

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity specialist with a strong passion for protecting digital systems and understanding how real-world cyber threats work. As a lifelong learner, I'm currently exploring tools like *Wireshark, Wazuh and pfSense* while building hands-on skills in ethical hacking, network monitoring, and threat detection.
Every small success whether it's detecting a suspicious packet or simulating a brute-force attack in a lab environment motivates me to keep learning and improving.

## Current Goals

- Learn how to configure IDS/IPS tools and firewalls
- Improve my ability to detect and respond to attacks
- Build a portfolio of cybersecurity projects and labs
- Grow my GitHub presence with real-world simulations and reports

## Fun Fact

I used to think cybersecurity was just about "hacking stuff," but now I see it as a powerful way to protect people, systems, and data. The more I learn, the more fascinated I become.
